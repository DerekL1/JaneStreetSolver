Used algorithms and techniques such as recursion, breadth-first-search, hill climbing, simulated annealing, reinforcement learning, and other heuristics to solve and optimize solutions for the [June Jane Stree Puzzle](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/altered-states-2-index/).

At the end of June, I achieved the top of the weighted leaderboard (accounting for both score and achievements).

Some of the best puzzles that I found throughout my testing:
